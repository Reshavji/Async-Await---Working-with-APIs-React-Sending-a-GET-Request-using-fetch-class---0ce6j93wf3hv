# Async Await

The app is supposed to work such that the <code>getData</code> function returns a promise(its an asynchronous function)
and we use it inside the component on mount to get data and display it. But there needs to be some changes made to
<code>getData</code> function such that it works inside the component.


Note:- Do not change code inside app component, only change  <code>getData</code> function.
